This package is an implementation of multi-precision iterative refinement for
linear matrix-vector problems of the form `A x = b`.

# Basic Usage
```julia
julia> using LinearAlgebra, IterativeRefinement
julia> x, bnorm, bcomp = rfldiv(A,b)
```
This provides an accurate solution vector `x` and estimated bounds
onf norm-wise and component-wise relative error. By default `LU` decomposition
is used.

# Advanced Usage
See the function docstring for details.

If one has several right-hand-sides, one can equilibrate and factor
`A` in advance; see the tests for an example.

# Background
The purpose of iterative refinement is to improve the accuracy of a
solution.  If `x` is the exact solution, a simple solve of the form
`y = A \ b` will have a relative forward error (`norm(y-x)/norm(x)`) of
approximately `ϵ * O(n) * cond(A)` where `ϵ` is the unit roundoff error
in the standard precision. Iterative refinement with higher precision
residuals can reduce this to `ϵ * O(n)`, as long as the matrix `A` is
not very badly conditioned relative to `ϵ`.

Why not do everything in high precision? The factorization step is
typically *much* more expensive in high precision, whereas the
residual computation is relatively cheap. Furthermore, this scheme
provides useful error bounds.

For typical use, one would have a working precision of `Float64`
(`ϵ = 2.2e-16`), so that fast LAPACK/BLAS routines dominate the runtime.
`rfldiv` will then use `Double64` from
[DoubleFloats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/DoubleFloats.jl)
for the residuals.

# Reference
To be precise, this package implements Algorithm 3 from J.Demmel et al.,
"Error bounds from extra precise iterative refinement",
LAPACK Working Note Nr. 165 (2005), also published as
ACM TOMS, 32, 325 (2006).  The work
described therein eventually turned into a collection of subroutines
included in some versions of LAPACK.  This implementation is based on
the paper; minor modifications were introduced based on experimentation.
